Overview
========
**Xcode and iOS Apps**
- Views are in .storyboard files
- code that operates on the views is in a `UIViewController`
- a `UIViewController` is linked to each screen in the storyboard

**The Code**
- **Variables** (also known as Objects): Store data about something (such as a `UILabel` in the view, or a piece of text)
- **Functions**: named blocks of code that can be run
- **Classes** (Didn't talk much about this): Blueprints for `Objects`

UITableViews
============
- used for displaying lists of data
- requires writing special functions that tell the view how to layout the list (how many items, what each item should look like)

Project
=======
Writing a todo list (we'll stick to this for the next couple of sessions)
